This Project mainly focuses on applying Neural Networks to predict the Crude Oil Price. implementing RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) with LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) to achieve the task.


This Project mainly focuses on applying Neural Networks to predict the Crude Oil Price. This decision helps us to buy crude oil at the proper time. Time series analysis is the best option for this kind of prediction because we are using the Previous history of crude oil prices to predict future crude oil. So we would be implementing RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) with LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) to achieve the task.
